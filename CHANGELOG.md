# Changelog

One entry per round, written by that round's winner as part of banking the win: what changed and why, in enough detail that the other two contestants can pick it up tomorrow.

## Round 0 - template (owner, 2026-08-17)

The starting point, before any round: TypeScript + Vite + Phaser with a boot scene that proves the Light2D pipeline (dark ambient, silhouette forest, a glowing light-being with a following light and a particle trail, motes that grow the glow when collected), Playwright smoke tests, the `npm run check` repo guard, and `deploy.sh` publishing to the four stable URLs.

Before round 1 the owner also added the round machinery: `ledger.json` + `LEDGER.md` (wins, tips and the escalating tip price), and `scripts/bank-round.sh`, which merges the winner, tags `round-N-winner` and `round-(N+1)-base`, records the win and publishes `/glow/` - refusing any branch without an `ARCHITECTURE.md` update and a `## Round N` entry here.
